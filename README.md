## Instructions to run the project

You can start your back-end and front-end app running the following commands:

**Back-end**  
```bash
cd backend
yarn
yarn develop
```
If the commands are succesful you should see the following message in your terminal:

`Strapi is running on http://localhost:1337`

**Front-end**
```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn develop
```
If the commands are succesful you should see the following message in your terminal:

`Gatsby is running on http://localhost:8000`

It is **important** that the backend is running so that the frontend can run without errors.
