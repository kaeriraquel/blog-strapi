You will notice that the node_modules folder is not found in the repository, so the yarn command must be executed. 

You can start your front-end and back-end app running the following command:

**Back-end**
cd backend 
yarn develop
Strapi is running on http://localhost:1337

**Front-end**
cd frontend 
yarn develop
Gatsby is running on http://localhost:8000

It is **important** that the backend is running so that the frontend can run without errors.
